    "Well done! You are very near the finish line!  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this last section, we will cover an interesting phenomena : the hidden relation between fluctuations and dissipation. \n",
    "Fluctuations might remind you of our discussion on error bars during the lecture. Error bars in any statistical ensemble,\n",
    "or repeated physical experiment, is obtained by the mean deviance (e.g. what is your average difference from the median), which can also be rewritten: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\sigma = \\left ( < E^2 > - <E>^2 \\right) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we are in particular interested in the error bars obtained for the measured energy $E$. For an ensemble\n",
    "of $N$ measurements, this formula can be rewritten as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\sigma = \\left ( \\frac{E^2} { N  }  - (\\frac{E}{N})^2 \\right) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also recall another interesting physical observable associated with the energy, the specific heat. This\n",
    "latter quantity measures how much energy is required to increase the temperature of the system, or more specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ C = \\frac{d E }{ dT} $\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next exercice, we propose that you measure both quantities with your Monte Carlo simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) calculate the statistical error bars obtained during the Monte Carlo simulation, according to the formula\n",
    "mentioned above. For this, you'll need to update the line of code which measures the energy, now you'd like\n",
    "to measure both the energy and the energy squared ($E$ and $E^2$). \n",
    "\n",
    "2) from the data obtained in the previous section, estimate the specific heat by calculating the variation of average\n",
    "energy obtained at two different temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compare both, and in particular verify the relation :\n",
    "\n",
    "$C = \\frac{1}{T^2} \\sigma $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation, always verified at equilibrium, connects the dissipation (how much energy required to heat the system),\n",
    "with the fluctuations of the given system. It is both a remarkable physical property, and also a useful feat for\n",
    "performing calculations: you can't obtain a precise estimate of the specific without carrying out several calculations,\n",
    "as required by the derivative of $C$ which requires two data set, and suffers from discretization errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, generalize your code to calculate $\\sigma$, and compare with the estimate of $C$ obtained by using\n",
    "the data obtained in the previous section.\n",
