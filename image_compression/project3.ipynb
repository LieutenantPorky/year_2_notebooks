    "# Mini Project 3 : Image Compression\n",

    "How many times have we faced this issue? We love clicking images with our smartphone cameras and saving random photos off the web. And then one day â€“ no space! Image compression helps deal with that headache.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mini-project, we investigage how linear algebra can be used to achieve efficient storage strategies, in particular in the context of image compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim here at using SVD, to minimize the size of an image in bytes to an acceptable level of quality. \n",
    "This means that you are able to store more images in the same disk space as compared to before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image compression takes advantage of the fact that only a few of the singular values obtained after SVD are large. You can trim the three matrices based on the first few singular values and obtain a compressed approximation of the original image. Some of the compressed images are nearly indistinguishable from the original by the human eye.\n",
